# Employee Burnout Analysis

This project, falling under the domain of **Data Science**, performs a comprehensive analysis of an employee dataset to explore factors contributing to burnout. The workflow involves data loading, cleaning, statistical inspection, visualization, and preprocessing—covering areas such as data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering—to understand patterns and prepare the data for potential future machine learning applications.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze an employee dataset with a focus on understanding burnout levels. The analysis includes:
- Exploratory data inspection
- Null value detection and imputation
- Visualizations of categorical and numerical variables
- Encoding and normalization for machine learning readiness

No predictive model is built in this notebook, but the dataset is preprocessed thoroughly for future use in classification or regression tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset appears to include the following features (as inferred from the analysis steps):
- `Employee ID`
- `Date of Joining`
- `Gender`
- `Company Type`
- `WFH Setup Available`
- `Designation`
- `Resource Allocation`
- `Mental Fatigue Score`
- `Burn Rate` *(target variable)*

Note: Some features are encoded or transformed during preprocessing.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Loading
- The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_csv()`.
- Initial structural checks (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Value counts and null value inspection.
- Grouping and basic statistical analysis by categories (e.g., by `gender`, `company_type`, etc.).

### 3. Data Visualization
- Count plots for gender, company type, remote work availability, and designation.
- Distribution plots for mental fatigue and resource allocation.
- Heatmap for correlation matrix.
- Boxplots for examining burnout distribution across categories.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- Dropping uninformative columns like `Employee ID` and `Date of Joining`.
- Handling missing values:
  - `Mental Fatigue Score`: filled with median.
  - `Burn Rate`: filled with mean.
- Encoding categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.
- Normalization using `MinMaxScaler`.

## Key Visualizations

- **Categorical Count Plots**: Understand distribution of employees across categories.
- **Burn Rate vs Gender/Company**: Boxplots to show how burnout varies across groups.
- **Heatmap**: Shows correlation between numerical features.
- **Distribution Plots**: For resource allocation and fatigue scores.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**: data manipulation
- **NumPy**: numerical operations
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: preprocessing

## Future Work

- Implement predictive models (classification or regression) for burnout.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
- Integrate dashboards using Streamlit or Plotly Dash for interactive exploration.
- Apply feature engineering and dimensionality reduction if needed.

## Final Conclusion

This project successfully prepares an employee dataset for burnout analysis through detailed preprocessing and visual exploration. Key findings include:

- Burnout levels show variation across **gender**, **company type**, and **remote work availability**.
- High **mental fatigue scores** and **resource allocation levels** are potential indicators of burnout risk.
- Correlation analysis reveals significant relationships between numeric features and the target (`Burn Rate`).

The dataset is now clean, encoded, and normalized—ready for model training in the next phase. This foundation enables future predictive modeling to help organizations identify and mitigate employee burnout risks effectively.
